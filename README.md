## Rules

1. *Game Start/Restart*
  * The game starts when one player from your team throws the frisbee while standing on your gate.
  * Players of the opposing team should all be behind the mid-line, on their side of the in-field. However it's up to the starting team to enforce this rule and the game can start before this rule is enforced.
2. *Movement*
  * Players can take no more than two steps before throwing the frisbee.
  * If you take more than two steps other players can call it a "three steps" and the other team gains priority.
  * When you hold the frisbee, other players can slowly count up to 10. If you are still holding the frisbee when 10 is counted the opponent team gains priority.
3. *Throws*
  * Players can either throw the frisbee or drop it on the ground.
  * Direct passes (when the frisbee is touched at the same time by two players) are not allowed. If you do a direct pass other players can call it a "holding pass" and the opponent team gains priority. 
  * Players in the out-field can only throw the frisbee in the direction of the in-field. If you break this rule, other players can call it an "out pass" and the opponent team gains priority. 
4. *Safety*
  * You cannot take the frisbee which is held by another player until they throw it or drop it.
  * If two players grab the frisbee at the same time, or with less than one second time difference, the game pauses and they play a rock-paper-scissors game to decide who gets the right to hold the frisbee.
4. *Score*
  * Your team scores a point if you catch a frisbee which was thrown from inside the opposing goal line by some other player and either:
    * you catch it inside the opposing goal line and then you cross the opponent gate while holding the frisbee, or
    * you cross the opponent gate outwards **after** the frisbee was thrown and then you catch it outside the opponent goal line (but not in the out-field) before it touches the ground or is caught by another player.
  * After your team scores a point, the opposing team restarts the game.
6. *Out*
  * If you throw the frisbee and it drops outside the opposing goal line the game stops and the opposing team restarts the game.
6. *Priority*
  * While your team has priority the other team cannot touch the frisbee, and they have to drop it if they are holding it. Your priority lasts until a member of your team grabs the frisbee.
  * As soon as you gain priority, if the frisbee was thrown on the ground in the out-field, you can call a "restart in-field" and pause the game to bring the frisbee to the closest point in the in-field from its current location before resuming the game.
